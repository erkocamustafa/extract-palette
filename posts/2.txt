<p>It is an ocean of blue.</p>

<p>There is a popular joke in the industry: <em>"When in doubt, use Blue."</em> It is the default uniform for the entire technology sector. But have you ever stopped to ask why? Is it just a lack of creativity, or is there something deeper going on?</p>

<h2>The Color of "No Panic"</h2>
<p>To understand Blue, you have to look at what it isn't.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Red</strong> signals danger, errors, or "Stop." It raises your heart rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow</strong> signals warning, caution, or anxiety.</li>
    <li><strong>Green</strong> is tied to money or success, but it can be distracting and hard to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blue is the only primary color that doesn't trigger a physical "alert" reaction. It signals stability, intelligence, and trust.</p>

<p>Think about it: If you are a company asking for a user's personal data, or a bank app asking for access to their life savings, you <strong>don't</strong> want to look exciting. You want to look boring. You want to look like a fortress. Blue says, <em>"Relax. We are stable. Nothing bad will happen here."</em></p>

<h2>The Facebook Effect</h2>
<p>Because Facebook became the dominant app of the 2010s, its design language unintentionally influenced thousands of startups. Designers copied Facebook because Facebook worked. Before we knew it, "Tech Blue" became the standard for credibility.</p>

<h2>It Disappears (In a Good Way)</h2>
<p>Great UI design should be invisible. You don't want the user staring at the buttons; you want them staring at the content (the photos, the messages, the videos).</p>

<p>Blue is the <strong>"denim jeans"</strong> of design. It goes with everything. It provides enough contrast to be readable but isn't aggressive enough to cause eye fatigue. It sits quietly in the background, doing its job.</p>

<h2>So, should you use it?</h2>
<p>If you are building a tool where trust is the most important factor, yes. Blue is your safest bet.</p>

<p>But be careful. Because everyone uses it, "Corporate Blue" can feel soulless. To stand out, avoid the standard navy blue. Go for <strong>Electric Blue</strong> or <strong>Indigo</strong>. Pair it with a warm accent color like Coral or Orange to break the coldness.</p>

<p>Use Blue because it works, not just because everyone else is doing it.</p>
